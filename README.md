Java OOP

Java is a flexible and popular programming language that supports the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). A programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming makes use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and control data and behavior. Java is a strong and adaptable language for creating sophisticated software systems because to its OOP characteristics.

Classes and Objects: In Java, everything is represented as objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.

Default Constructor: If you don't define any constructors in your class, Java provides a default, no-argument constructor. It initializes the object with default values (e.g., numeric fields to 0, references to null).

Object Methods: are special methods that every class inherits from the Object class, which is the root class for all Java classes. These methods provide default implementations for common operations that can be performed on objects.

Encapsulation: is the practice of hiding the internal state of an object and providing a controlled interface to interact with it. In Java, this is achieved through access modifiers (public, private, protected) and getters and setters.
